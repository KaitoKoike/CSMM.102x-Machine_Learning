## CSMM.102x Machine Learning

I took edX CSMM.102x Machine Learning in September 2017 for 12 weeks and these are my personal notes, They aren't pretty, there are a few missing bits and I don't expect to update them.
SPOILER WARNING: The assessment notebooks do work and the code is similar to my code that passed.
The lecture handouts are not included here but, the course is free.

I found the course quite challenging, as I don't even have high-school maths (I was 15 at the time).
It was well explained and I liked the maths heavy aspect, as I hadn't experienced this at all before.
It focuses on the learning bit of ML, they don't talk about practically using it.
Think of it as nice overview of ML, a good course if you're starting out but, expect to be challenged.
I scored 93% so it's not that hard.
